IMPROVEMENTS:
1) Move all lists to dashboard!!! (change labels if)
2) Quick/Advanced to dashboard???

client edit: Make province (ON) = to Ontario
client delete: line 134 / make it so I delete with user id instead of client numb

1) Access levels
active account	

URGENT!!!

10/20...

doesn't match row count...

DB manager / EmployeeCreate

Gotta make it so it matches the row count!!!


1) Create VideoList.vb
2) Create EmployeeList.vb

when.show() = true then
close form

USE CASE ONE:

1) use md5 and make password ****

Dashboard:

1) Button 1 then listbox1
Button 2 then listbox2
Button 3 then listbox3

or is there another way?

Create Client:

1)Add labels 

if typeOfCard.text.length >= 1 then
	LBL_typeOfCard.enabled
	LBL_cardNumber.enabled
	LBL_expirationDate.enabled

*make the asteriks visible if the typeOfCard is written into
*Remove when it's blank.

2)Toolbox -> Help providor on credit information
  ToolBox -> Error provider

3)Make clients credit card "****-****-****-4883" when on edit or delete so that
data isn't released to admin/employee.

4)Enabled = false on CreateDelete

5) Client number auto generated?  Random?

6) Timer for auto signout when no clicks/no mouse movements

7) TB_age.text = TB_dob.text (year, month, day) - datetime.now
(Auto set age when dob is set)

Delete Client:

8)Remove asteriks?

Delete Employee:

1) Active/Inactive employees,  just enable = false
